                          <p>
                            Systematic Theology is the study of the truths of the Bible, grouped and arranged according to a logical system.
                            For example, the person of Jesus is studied in a subject called Christology, which pull together and arranges what the whole Bible teaches about who exactly Jesus is and what Jesus has done for the world.
                            In another example, the study of Eschatology pulls together what the whole Bible teaches about what happens when we die and at the return of Jesus.
                            </p>
                          <br />
                          <p>
                            Systematic theology helps us, therefore, to acquire a deeper and wider grasp of all the truths of the Bible, and how these truths integrate.
                            The study of systematic theology is of course very helpful for those who are in church leadership, and who have some kind of teaching role in the church: whether in Sunday school or youth group,
                            in a one-on- one discipleship context, or in Sunday preaching. And when a Christian deepens and widens their theology, they are transformed and equipped to withstand harmful falsehoods, and to know God’s truth and will for their lives.
                            They are putting into action the command of Paul in Romans 12:2, “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”
                            </p>
                          <br />
                          <p>
                            The two-year study Systematic Theology Course being offered by Cornerstone Presbyterian Church in Hobart is intentionally demanding and comprehensive.
                            The course consists of eight modules, each of which includes twelve hours of lectures. The course will constantly adhere to the maxim that Theology leads to Doxology.
                              Theology (the study of God) must always lead to Doxology (the praise of God.) To remind us of this, every evening will begin with prayer and will end with sung praise.</p>

                                    The course is taught by Campbell Markham, who is an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church of Australia, is passionate about God’s Word, and has been teaching the Bible full time for almost twenty years.
                                    (Guest lecturers will be invited from time-to- time to teach specific subjects.) The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646), which is itself a classic systematic theology, forms the doctrinal standard of the course.
