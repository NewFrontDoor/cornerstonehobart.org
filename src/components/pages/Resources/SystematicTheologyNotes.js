                        <h3 className="header-lightBlue text-center">Two-year Systematic Theology Course, 2018-19</h3>
                        <p>Systematic Theology is the study of the truths of the Bible, grouped and arranged according&nbsp;to a logical system.<br/>
                        For example, the person of Jesus is studied in a subject called Christology, which pulls&nbsp;together and arranges what the whole Bible teaches about who exactly Jesus is and what&nbsp;Jesus has done for the world. In another example, the study of Eschatology pulls together&nbsp;what the whole Bible teaches about what happens when we die and at the return of Jesus.</p>
                        <p>Systematic theology helps us, therefore, to acquire a deeper and wider grasp of all the&nbsp;truths of the Bible, and how these truths integrate.&nbsp;The study of systematic theology is of course very helpful for those who are in church<br/>
                        leadership, and who have some kind of teaching role in the church: whether in Sunday&nbsp;school or youth group, in a one-on- one discipleship context, or in Sunday preaching.&nbsp;And when a Christian deepens and widens their theology, they are transformed and&nbsp;equipped to withstand harmful falsehoods, and to know God’s truth and will for their lives.<br/>
                        They are putting into action the command of Paul in Romans 12:2, “Do not conform any&nbsp;longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”&nbsp;The two-year study Systematic Theology Course being offered by Cornerstone Presbyterian&nbsp;Church in Hobart is intentionally demanding and comprehensive. The course consists of&nbsp;eight modules, each of which includes twelve hours of lectures.&nbsp;The course will constantly adhere to the maxim that Theology leads to Doxology. Theology&nbsp;(the study of God) must always lead to Doxology (the praise of God.) To remind us of this,&nbsp;every evening will begin with prayer and will end with sung praise.<br/>
                        There are two levels of participation for each module:&nbsp;FULL: Attend six two-hour classes on Tuesday nights. Participate in ten-minute&nbsp;review quizzes at the beginning of each lecture. Complete lecture readings (about fifty<br/>
                        pages per week). Submit within two weeks of the end of the course a one to two thousand&nbsp;word non-academic essay on a given question.</p>
                        <p>AUDIT: Attend six two-hour classes on Tuesday nights. Participate in ten-minute&nbsp;review quizzes at the beginning of each lecture.<br/>
                        The course is taught by Campbell Markham, who is an ordained minister in the Presbyterian&nbsp;Church of Australia, is passionate about God’s Word, and has been teaching the Bible&nbsp;full time for almost twenty years. (Guest lecturers will be invited from time-to- time to teach&nbsp;specific subjects.) The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646), which is itself a classic&nbsp;systematic theology, forms the doctrinal standard of the course.</p>

                        Unit One, Feb-Mar 2018. Revelation &amp; Inspiration<br/>
                        The true and living God has revealed himself in a general way: through his creation to all&nbsp;humanity at all times; and in a special way: through supernatural means to his people at&nbsp;specific times, as recorded in Scripture. Come and learn about general and special&nbsp;revelation, about the Bible and all of its extraordinary attributes, about how the Bible came&nbsp;to be written and assembled, and about how we can be absolutely confident today that we<br/>
                        can read exactly what was written in the Bible thousands of years ago. “But his delight is in&nbsp;the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night” (Psalm 1:2).<br/>

                        1) What does the Bible teach about the nature and purpose of miracles? Does the answer<br/>
                        to this question help you answer the question as to whether miracles continue to occur<br/>
                        today?<br/>
                        2) What do you consider to be the five most important attributes of Scripture, and why?<br/>
                        3) After carefully reading the Chicago Statement on Inerrancy (1978) what new things have<br/>
                        you learned about the Bible?<br/>
